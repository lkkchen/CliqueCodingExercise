# Clique Coding Execise Case 1

## Set up and run project

This project is a simple GraphQL service written in NestJS framework. We build it with code-first method, which means the schema.gql in the root directory is generated by code every time when the codebase is built. As a side note, we prefer yarn over npm. You can build and run the project with the following commands.

```bash
# install packages
$ yarn
# run project
$ yarn start
```

After running the above commands, you should be able to get a GraphQL playground under http://localhost:3000/graphql. Below is a sample query:

```js
query RecipeQuery {
  recipe(id: "1") {
    id
    title
    description
    ingredients
    creationDate
    forNumPeople
  }
}
```

## Question

1. Could you update the code such that it can attach a condition to each field and returns true when the condition is met, false otherwise? Ideally, we need to attach comparison functions based on the field type through code generation:
    1. Field with Int type
        1. eq: Int => Bool   # equal to
        2. gt: Int => Bool   # greater than
        3. gte: Int => Bool  # greater than or equal to
        4. lt: Int => Bool   # less than
        5. lte: Int => Bool  #Â less than or equal to
    2. Field with String type
        1. eq: String => Bool
        2. eq_nocase: String => Bool
        3. contains: String => Bool
        4. contains_nocase: String => Bool
        5. starts_with: String => Bool
        6. starts_with_nocase: String => Bool
        7. ends_with: String => Bool
        8. ends_with_nocase: String => Bool
2. Examples of such conditions: 
    1. Check if a cuisine is for 5 people, and it should return true/false for the field `recipe.forNumPeople`.
    2. Check if a cuisine description contains `Sichuan`.
